# What Material

A simple Fabric Minecraft utility mod to check basic information about an ItemStack.

## Usage

This mod is fully command driven. Use one of the following commands to check out the ItemStack's
Identifier, ItemGroup and Material.

- `/what material`
- `/wm`
- `info material`

All commands will check the player's main hand and if that is empty, the offhand.

You can also specify an ItemStack (just like with the `/give` command) after all the newly
added Commands. If this command is not executed by a player, specifying the ItemStack is
mandatory.
